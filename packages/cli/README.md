# asciidoc-testkit CLI — invocation contract

The CLI runs the shared fixture corpus against an **external converter
process**, so it can test a converter written in any language without that
converter depending on asciidoc-testkit at all — it just has to already be a
CLI (or be wrapped by a small script that behaves like one).

## Command shape

```
asciidoc-testkit run --expected <dir> [--extension <ext>] [--timeout <ms>] [--update] -- <command...>
```

- `--expected <dir>` (required) — directory holding the caller's own expected
  output, mirroring the corpus layout: `<family>/<name>.<extension>`. Same
  convention as `expectedDir` in the JS API. A fixture case with no matching
  file there is reported `skipped`, not run — `--update` doesn't change that,
  see below.
- `--extension <ext>` — expected output file extension, without the dot.
  Default: `html`.
- `--timeout <ms>` — kill the converter process if a single case takes longer
  than this. Default: `10000`.
- `--update` — snapshot-testing style: instead of comparing, overwrite each
  matched case's expected file with what the converter produces right now.
  Reported as `updated`, not `pass`/`fail`. Only regenerates expected files
  that already exist — it does not create files for `skipped` cases, i.e. it
  never silently grows a project's corpus. Adopting a new case is a deliberate
  act: create the (even empty) expected file yourself first, then `--update`
  it.
- `-- <command...>` — the converter invocation, given as argv (not a shell
  string — no shell is involved, so no quoting/escaping ambiguity and no
  injection risk from fixture content). Everything after `--` is passed
  through as-is, except for two recognized placeholder tokens:
  - `{input}` — replaced with the path to a temp file containing the fixture's
    AsciiDoc source for that case.
  - `{output}` — replaced with the path to a (not-yet-existing) temp file the
    converter is expected to write its output to.

## Input/output wiring

- If `{input}` is **not** present in the command, the fixture's AsciiDoc
  source is written to the process's **stdin** instead.
- If `{output}` is **not** present in the command, the process's **stdout**
  is captured and used as the actual output instead.

This covers both converter styles without forcing either one:

```sh
# stdin/stdout — e.g. the asciidoctor CLI
asciidoc-testkit run --expected test/fixtures --extension html -- \
  bundle exec asciidoctor -b revealjs -o - -

# file-based — e.g. a converter that must read/write real files
asciidoc-testkit run --expected test/fixtures --extension html -- \
  my-converter --backend revealjs {input} --out {output}
```

The command runs **once per fixture case**. There is no persistent worker /
batching in this version — for a corpus in the hundreds of cases this is
adequate; a persistent-process protocol is a possible future extension if a
converter's startup cost makes that too slow, but it is not part of this
contract.

## Per-case outcome

For each case in the corpus with a matching expected file:

| Process exit code | Comparison result   | Reported status |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| `0`                 | actual == expected (via the same comparator as the JS API) | `pass` |
| `0`                 | actual != expected | `fail`, with a line diff |
| non-zero, or timeout | —                 | `error`, with captured stderr |

Cases with no matching expected file are reported `skipped` and never spawn
the converter.

## Reporting and exit status

The CLI prints one line per `fail`/`error`/`updated` case (with its diff or
stderr for the first two), then a summary (`N passed, N failed, N errored,
N updated, N skipped`). It exits `0` only if there were zero `fail` and zero
`error` cases — `skipped` and `updated` cases do not affect the exit code.

## Native binary

`npm run build:sea` produces a standalone executable for the host platform at
`dist/asciidoc-testkit-<platform>-<arch>` — a [Node.js Single Executable
Application](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html), so
it runs with no Node.js or npm install required on the machine that uses it
(that's the point: a Ruby/Rust/Java project shells out to this binary, not to
`node`). The fixture corpus is inlined into the binary at build time (see
`tasks/sea/inline-fixtures-plugin.js`); the produced binary carries no
dependency on this repo's files. SEA cannot cross-compile, so building
binaries for other platforms means running the build on one machine per
target (linux x64, linux arm64, macOS arm64, win x64).

## Non-goals (for now)

- No per-case converter flags/attributes — the same command runs for every
  case in a given invocation. If a converter needs different flags for
  different constructs, that's a signal to split the run (e.g. one
  `--expected` subdirectory and invocation per concern) rather than something
  this contract encodes.
- No structured (JSON) reporter yet — text output only.
- No persistent-process/batching mode yet (see above).
- No built-in tolerance for cosmetically-different-but-equivalent HTML
  (attribute order, `attr=""` vs bare `attr`, `style` value formatting) — the
  comparator is a pluggable option in the JS API precisely so this kind of
  tolerance, or output-format-specific fragment extraction (HTML vs XML vs
  plain-text...), can be layered on later without redesigning the contract.
  For now these are reported as real differences.
